## Bangkit Capstone Project 2023
This is our repository for the Bangkit 2023 Capstone project - Mobile Development.

## Description
The Obeng App (Online "Bengkel") is a digital platform that provides online repair services for automotive devices. Through the app, clients can easily call on certified and reliable technicians to repair their damaged devices. The app offers a freelancer marketplace concept, allowing clients to choose the most suitable technician for their needs by reviewing their portfolios before making a call. The main goal of the Obeng app is to simplify and speed up the process of repairing automotive devices online with reliable and quality services.

In today's digital era, people need an easy and practical digital platform to fix their automotive devices. However, it can be difficult to find reliable and trustworthy technicians for the job, and comparing services between technicians can be time-consuming. The Obeng app addresses these issues by providing a digital platform that simplifies the process of finding reliable and qualified technicians.
